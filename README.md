## Learning Objectives

* Who designed and implemented the original UNIX operating system
* Who wrote the first version of the UNIX shell
* Who invented the B programming language, which is the predecessor to the C programming language
* Who Ken Thompson is
* How the shell works
* What a pid and ppid are
* How to manipulate the environment of the current process
* What the difference between a function and a system call is
* How to create processes
* What the 3 prototypes of main are
* How the shell uses the environment variable PATH to find the programs
* How to execute programs with the execve system call
* How to suspend a process until one or all of its children terminates
* What end-of-file (EOF) is.

## Requirements
* Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
* All files must be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
* All of our files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`
* Your shell should not have any memory leaks
* No more than 5 functions per file
* All our header files should be guarded


## Output
* Unless specified our program **must have the exact same output** as `sh`(`/bin/sh`) as well as the exact same error output.
* The only difference is when we print an error, the name of the program must be equivalent to our `argv[0]`.
